While reaching house i thief has two options, either he robs it or leave it.
 Let dp[i] represents the maximum value stolen so far on reaching house i. We can calculate the value of dp[i] as following â€“

dp[i] = max (hval[i] + dp[i-2], dp[i-1])

hval[i] + dp[i-2] is the case when thief
decided to rob house i. In that situation
maximum value will be the current value of
house + maximum value stolen till last
robbery at house not adjacent to house
i which will be house i-2.

dp[i-1] is the case when thief decided not
to rob house i. So he will check adjacent
house for maximum value stolen till now.
